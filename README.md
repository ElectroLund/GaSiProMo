__OsRAM intelligent display__

I’m going to get this display up and running.  It’s an intelligent LED matrix.  I might even throw in a keypad to change the patterns and such.

I’ve had this display module lying in my Big Bin of Parts for… more than 10 years.  At this point:

I’m not convinced it even works.
I don’t know what color the LEDs are (the module comes in yellow, red, and green).
And I’m certainly not convince it will be that cool, but at least it’s a project that I’ve always wanted to do.

Got the display mounted to a breadboard.  How about that, it's green!
The display has a self test diagnostic mode built in, which is incredibly handy.  Saw little cute LED bits flashing and twinkling.  So the thing appears to be alive, after all these years!

Next step: wire up the Atmega Arduino.  This will be a big trek into the unknown for me. I haven't done much with Arduino yet.
