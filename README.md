I’m going to get this display up and running.  It’s an intelligent LED matrix.  I might even throw in a keypad to change the patterns and such.

I’ve had this display module lying in my Big Bin of Parts for… more than 10 years.  At this point:

I’m not convinced it even works.
I don’t know what color the LEDs are (the module comes in yellow, red, and green).
And I’m certainly not convince it will be that cool, but at least it’s a project that I’ve always wanted to do.
